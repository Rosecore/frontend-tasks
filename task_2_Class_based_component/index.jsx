/**
 * Even though we don't write code in class components, 
 * there is a lot of legacy code in the project that we have to work with. 
 * We want to make sure that you are familiar with class components.
 * 
 * Rewrite this functional component as a class-based component.
 * This component contains multiple useEffect hooks with different dependencies 
 * and an additional state that influences rendering.
 * 
 * Make sure the class-based component mirrors the behavior of the provided functional component.
 * 
 * Task:
 * - Rewrite this functional component as a class-based component.
 * - Implement component lifecycle methods in place of useEffect hooks.
 * - Ensure that initial values of `count` and `clicks` are logged upon mounting.
 * - Maintain correct behavior when props or state change.
